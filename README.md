# Let's Encrypt

Letâ€™s Encrypt is a free, automated, and open certificate authority brought to you by the non-profit Internet Security Research Group (ISRG).

## Installing Let's Encrypt

We need to start by updating the local server's apt package indexes

`sudo apt-get update`

We can now install the Let's Encrypt Client

`sudo apt-get install letsencrypt`

## Obtaining the certificate

`sudo letsencrypt certonly --standalone --email youremail@example.com -d yourdomain.com`

After running this command  a few dialogs will appear. Follow their instructions until you reach the end.

The output should look similar to this one below.

```
IMPORTANT NOTES:
 - If you lose your account credentials, you can recover through
   e-mails sent to sammy@digitalocean.com
 - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem. Your
   cert will expire on 2016-03-15. To obtain a new version of the
   certificate in the future, simply run Let's Encrypt again.
 - Your account credentials have been saved in your Let's Encrypt
   configuration directory at /etc/letsencrypt. You should make a
   secure backup of this folder now. This configuration directory will
   also contain certificates and private keys obtained by Let's
   Encrypt so making regular backups of this folder is ideal.

You will now have four PEM-encoded files in the following location

`/etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com`

Files:

* **cert.pem**: Your domain's certificate
* **chain.pem**: The Let's Encrypt chain certificate
* **fullchain.pem**: cert.pem and chain.pem combined
* **privkey.pem**: Your certificate's private key
